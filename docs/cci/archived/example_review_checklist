The following items should be verified as part of our examples review process; 
please add to this list as new issues are encountered.

- Rename example-specific files (using git mv ...) and classes for uniqueness
  (e.g. config_ip.h -> ex06_config_ip.h)
  This avoids confusion when reviewing doxygen documentation.
  - Corresponding source code changes are required; don't forget to fix comment
    references too.
- Fix copy/paste carryover in comments (e.g. referencing the wrong example)
- Remove unnecessary commented code (keep any that is optional or propositional)
- Use XREPORT for consistent output reporting
- Verify correctness of the PowerPoint presentations
  - Are simulation output excerpts up-to-date?
- Fix doxygen comments for consistency as prescribed in doxygen_guidelines.
- Updated legal header

  3.1 of the license agreement.  The Example 06 sources can serve as a reference.


Items still requiring some discussion:
- Updating PowerPoint build instructions (verify.pl vs. make vs. make wrapper)
- Run code beautifier for formatting consistency
- Remove Make remnants (primarily the build-unix directories)
