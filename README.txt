README.txt
----------

This file provides brief instructions for getting started with the CCI 
Configuration standard.  

- unpack the CCI Config release kit (producing cci-1.0.0/)

- generate doxygen documentation in doc/ for a useful reference:
   doxygen cci_doxygen_examples.conf
   doxygen cci_doxygen_api_ref.conf
   Note: this may require installing doxygen and its dependent packages, such
         as graphviz.

- review the generated documentation in:
   doc/Examples/index.html
   doc/API_ref/index.html

- build the proof-of-concept library:
  Instructions are provided here for Linux; see msvc10/cci/README.txt for 
  Windows instructions.

  - Initialize environment variables
    - CCI_HOME (release kit root, e.g. .../cci-1.0.0)
    - SYSTEMC_HOME (top-level, e.g. .../systemc-2.3.2)

  - Change to the .../cci-1.0.0/src/ directory and invoke 'gmake'

    Additional flags to pass on the gmake command-line to customize
    the behavior:
      V=1       - build in verbose mode     (default: V=0)
      OPT=-O2   - build with optimization   (default: OPT=-g)
      CXX       - override compiler         (default: g++)
      CXXFLAGS  - additional compiler flags (default: empty)

- build the provided examples
  - follow instructions in examples/README.txt
    Note: be sure to review the PowerPoint presentation in each example's docs/
    directory for insights and explanations
