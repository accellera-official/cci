About SystemC CCI
-----------------

  The Configuration, Control and Inspection (CCI) standard enables greater 
  interoperability of SystemC models within the SystemC ecosystem. 
  It allows tools and models to work together to provide valuable user-level
  capabilities. The first phase of this standard addresses model configuration.
  The roadmap includes checkpointing and register introspection.

  The SystemC CCI Working Group addressed several key concerns while defining
  the 1.0 standard. Of critical importance is the ability to interact with 
  tools for which a portable value representation has been provided, along 
  with information about configuration parameters, including a description 
  and flexible metadata. Among the fundamental features in the standard are 
  avoiding name clashes with elements of the SystemC object hierarchy, 
  looking up and accessing configuration parameters, restricting access to 
  parameters, preloading configuration settings, callbacks for parameter 
  creation/destruction as well as value access, traceability of parameter 
  value updates, and support for user-defined parameter value types.

  This SystemC CCI package is the *reference implementation* provided by
  the [Accellera Systems Initiative][1] and is being developed by the 
  Accellera SystemC CCI Working Group.
  
  In the event of discrepancies between the behavior of this implementation and
  statements made in the [CCI 1.0 Language Reference Manual](https://www.accellera.org/images/downloads/standards/systemc/SystemC_CCI_1_0_LRM.pdf),
  the LRM standard shall be taken to be definitive.

About Accellera SystemC Working Groups
--------------------------------------

  Accellera hosts different SystemC Working Groups to address the various
  aspects of Electronic System-Level (ESL) modeling and simulation:
  
  * SystemC [Language Working Group][3]: Working Group responsible for the 
    definition and development of the SystemC and TLM core languages, the
    foundation on which all other SystemC libraries and functionality are built.
  
  * SystemC [CCI Working Group][6]: Working Group responsible for the 
    Configuration, Control and Inspection (CCI) extensions of SystemC, to
    enable tools to interact with models in order to perform activities 
    such as setup, debug and analysis.
  
  * SystemC [AMS Working Group][7]: Working Group responsible for the 
    Analog/Mixed-Signal extensions of SystemC, to enable abstract modeling 
    approaches for analog, mixed-signal and radio-frequency functionality.

  * SystemC [Synthesis Working Group][8]: Working Group responsible for the
    synthesizable subset of SystemC to enable High-Level Synthesis (HLS).
    
  * SystemC [Verification Working Group][9]: Working Group responsible for the
    verification extensions of SystemC, introducing UVM in SystemC library and 
    the SystemC Verification library (SCV).
