1) What's new in this release?
==============================

TLM2 and SystemC regressions are now combined into this single suite.

Compatibility across different platforms has been greatly improved.

Improved coverage of SystemC features, including new IEEE Std 1666-2011 regression tests.


2) Bug fixes and enhancements
=============================

This is a summary of the main changes:

  - Combined SystemC regressions and TLM2 Unit Tests into a single structure.
  
  - Improved include structure.
  
  - Regression script verify.pl now tested on many platforms, so multiple copies of the 
    script have been removed.


3) Other changes
================

Here is an overview of changes with respect to the previous release:


4) Known limitations
====================

Here is a list of known limitations in this release:

  - Not all options of the verify.pl script are fully functional.

  - The regression test suite does not cover all the SystemC source code,
    though it is improved compared to previous versions.

  - Some datatype tests take a long time to either compile or run.

  - On Mac OS X 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard), the verify.pl script does not
    detect the x86_64 architecture correctly. You can run the
    regressions against a 32-bit version of SystemC.
